To download the latest Eclipse for Java and Web Developer, visit [this link](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) and download for your operating system. And to download Apache Tomcat 10.1.41, click on [this link](https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.41/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.41.zip) or visit [this site](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi). At the time you are downloading these files, the versions I mention here may not be the latest. I recommend you always use the latest and the greatest!
> For this setup to run, you don't have to have Java installed in your system. Eclipse comes with its own JDK distribution. Actually you don't have to install this Eclipse package also, this is a portable package. Just unzip it, open the folder, double click on the executable, and get it up and running.
